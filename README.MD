# Digital Library

Welcome to the Digital Library! This is a terminal-based application I made for a school project that allows you to manage and explore a collection of books.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Easily add new books to your library.
- **View Books**: View all the books available in your library.
- **Search Books**: Search for books by title or author.
- **Delete Books**: Remove books from your library.
